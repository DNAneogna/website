# Why We’re Talking About Our Children’s DNA

In recent months, it became known — not through an announcement by the Ministry of Health, but through investigative journalism — that Greece is planning a program to analyze the full genome (Whole Genome Sequencing - WGS) of all newborns.

Although the technology holds promise for the future of medicine, applying it to all children **without public consultation, a legal framework, or parental consent** raises serious concerns:

- Who will have access to our children’s DNA?
- How will families’ freedom and protection be ensured?
- Is this the best way to promote child health?

195 scientists have joined their voices in **an open letter**, calling for **dialogue, transparency, and accountability**.

This website was created to inform, to foster public dialogue, and to equip citizens with the tools to take part in decisions that affect the future of our children.
